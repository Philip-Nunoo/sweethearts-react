This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Problem statement

* Create a small Facebook Instant Game [1] using React. The game logic should be similar to [kamelrechner.eu](http://kamelrechner.eu/en/male). You can basically just clone the provided camel example or be creative with another topic. The UI should consist of the following elements:
    * **Start Page:** Render a form with multiple inputs. Keep the form plain and simple, just focus on the code. The UI doesn’t have to look good. There is no need to add any images.
  * **Result Page:** Depending on the provided inputs calculate and show the result. The result page should contain a share button to share the result via Facebook SDK share-button functionality [2].

* Use a bundler like webpack to provide a zipped/minified/uglified version as well as a function to run the code in a staging/dev environment.
* Don’t worry too much about CSS or general styling. Ideally integrate a CSS framework like bulma [3] to have basic styling possibilities available.
* Write clean and professional code, ideally separate business logic from display logic
* Provide us with a github/gitlab repository that includes all commits and code so we can see how you approached this test-task.
Don’t spend more than 5 hours on this test-task. If you didn’t finish everything, just show us how far you got.
* Last but not least: Have fun! :)
